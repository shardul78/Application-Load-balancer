# Application-Load-balancer
This project showcases the deployment of an Application Load Balancer (ALB) using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to manage traffic across multiple EC2 instances. The ALB is configured with health checks to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy servers, providing a reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant web infrastructure.
